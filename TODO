1. Check case where two natural fragments are right next to each other and so don't have overlap
	(could generate primers which have overlaps in them, or generate a separate adaptor sequence which overlaps with both)
2. Get combinatorial generation working with natural fragments
3. Work on graphical display of where natural fragments come from
	(display sequence with list of color coded natural fragments)
4. Get primer3 verification working
5. Check case where natural fragment has no valid primers
6. Write a manual
